# Customnest
This mod is planning to make a mod to replace al visual files and the audio files as well
the mod will work like the customknight mod, and you can find the files in the same location as the mod.
The code from customknight will be used, and upgraded, and will be a huge help to not have to setup the entire work somebody already did.
So a huge thanks to seresharp who made the customknight mod, you should also check out his profile, becouse he has other awesome mods on his profile, while we are just some idiots with a copmuter, and time to waste.
